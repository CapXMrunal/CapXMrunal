## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
##I'm a programming and robotics enthusiast. Currently keen on learning coding and programming to become expert in the field. 
Am trying to connect and work with mentors or peers on different projects, researches or competitions which involves and provides practical knowledge and hands on experience in different computing technologies.

The passion of learning anything that can comprehend humans visualization whether a computer, code or any tech keeps me fueled to learn more, explore more and visualize more.

The deep rooted urge to understand and learn everything in the technological sector has brought me to DTU where I am pursuing B. Tech in Information Technology. Thus the 'T' in DTU amazes me with the opportunity it brings to me.
